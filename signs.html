      <p class="w3-large">the right hand depicts what is going to happen. generally each hand has the basic lines, these are the line of 
        life, the line of the brain and the line of the heart. however there are other lines like the line of health which is next to the 
        line of life. still meets the wedding line, which is located under the little finger. 
        
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">another line that belongs to the basic lines is the line of luck,
        extend to the middle finger and located in the center of the palm. beyond these lines another important one is like
        the money line. the palm has not only the basic lines but also signs, which are as forewarn otherwise as a good sign.
The analysis of the hand is based on whether you are right-handed or left-handed.</p>
      for the analysis of one hand you will pay<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">12 euros.</span></p>

        hand we can penetrate the left hand and see them. what career one will follow one can understand from the right
        hand but what hidden talent has been shown on the left. there are rare cases where one can have three different fortunes. 
       
        
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">if you have noticed the finger lines are not the same, there are other
        lines on the left hand others on the right hand fingers. the lines of the head or brain are not the same as meaning 
        that skills are being developed. even if they are the same it means that the person has set for only one job in his life..</p>

      <h4>About us</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">we have been dealing with this ancient art of palmistry for 7 years. We have analyzed several 
        hands of people since of course they have told us their stories. we have noticed that as a person gets older some signs change.</p><br>
    
      <h4>What we do</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Our concern is first the analysis of the basic lines then we analyze in two lines such
        as the line of life with the line of health. then we look at the size of the hand, the fingers. then we start
        for the analysis of very important elements such as the signs. the signs can be a cross, a fish, a swastika, a square, circles, etc. </p><br>
    
      <h4>How to send photo</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The only you have to do is just take a photo maybe from your phone or from pc and send photo of your hand in this email adress
      , petemary49@gmail.com. take the photo clean so that it shows all the elements of your hand and it is bright. </p><br>
    
      <h4>How to pay</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> All payments are made only via paypal. Before you pay you must first send your photo to the email and then pay to start analyse your hand.
